Fix Monitor Brightness buttons not working-
Install xdotool
xdotool key 232 and xdotool key 233 commands decreases and increases screen brightness respectively.
Map the two commands to F11 and F12 from the custom shortcuts in settings.
Now this changes brightness directly in Gnome.
Fact: /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness gives current monitor brightness.
