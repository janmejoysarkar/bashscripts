Fix Monitor Brightness buttons not working-
Install xdotool
xdotool key 232 and xdotool key 233 commands decreases and increases screen brightness respectively.
Map the two commands to F11 and F12 from the custom shortcuts in settings.
Now this changes brightness directly in Gnome.
Fact: /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness gives current monitor brightness.
Ref- https://itectec.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-lenovo-ideapad-brightness-keys-not-generating-any-events-in-ubuntu-16-04-1/

Update: For use with i3wm, the screen backlight brightness can be changed with 
brightnessctl set 40% #setbacklight to 40%
But this requires root previliges. To remove root access use chown to make yourself the owner of this file- /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness

xrandr --output [device name] --brightness [0-1] can be used to change the LCD brightness. This does not reduce backlight. Good for desktop monitors.

 Transparent Taskbar and menus:
Method 2. This will require altering the default theme. Make a backup of /usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme/default/metadata.desktop. Open it with root rights. Change in the [ContrastEffect] section enabled=true to false. Re-login.
Now the panel(s) become semi-transparent. As a bonus the main menu also becomes semi-transparent with blur effect under it.

 Using Dolphin in i3wm
 Dolphin icons dont show up by default as it is a Qt application and i3wm is not a Qt environment. So a Qt emulator has to be installed.
 sudo apt install qt5ct
 create ~/.bash_profile
 add the line export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct 
 This asks bash to qt5ct as the Qt platform theme.
 Launch qt5ct to modify fonts and iconpacks.
 Logout and login to see the changes.

 Enable tap to click on touchpad with X11. Works to enable tap to click on i3wm.
 
 https://cravencode.com/post/essentials/enable-tap-to-click-in-i3wm/
 
 X11 provides configurations in a directory “X11/xorg.conf.d/” this directory could live in various places on your system depending on your distribution.

However, X11 will always attempt to also load configurations from /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ when present.

To ensure the directory exists, run:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
Copy code
Next we’ll create a new file “90-touchpad.conf”. The configuration file names end with .conf and are read in ASCII order—by convention file names begin with two digits followed by a dash.

sudo touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-touchpad.conf
Copy code
Now open up the file your editor of choice (with suitable write permission of course) and paste the following:

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
EndSection
Copy code
Additional libinput options
Libinput support additional options beyond tapping, you can add and configure each one by adding them on new lines after Option "Tapping" "on" in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-touchpad.conf, for example:

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "TappingButtonMap" "lrm"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
        Option "ScrollMethod" "twofinger"
EndSection
Copy code
Two and three finger tap
Two and three finger tap configurations can be set with to have two finger tap to cause a right-click and three finger tap to cause a middle-click with:

        Option "TappingButtonMap" "lrm"
Copy code
Or two make a two finger tap do a middle-click and a three finger tap to cause a right-click:

        Option "TappingButtonMap" "lmr"
Copy code
Natural scrolling
Natural scrolling can be enabled with:

        Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
Copy code

Enable/Disable conda base environment from starting in bash

conda config --set auto_activate_base false
The first time you run it, it'll create a .condarc in your home directory with that setting to override the default. This wouldn't de-clutter your .bash_profile but it's a cleaner solution without manual editing that section that conda manages.

To enable base environ- conda config --set auto_activate_base true

Set power key to lock and suspend

install xss-lock to lock the screen before it suspends. xss-lock is started by the i3config by default.

HandlePowerKey=suspend
PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=yes
