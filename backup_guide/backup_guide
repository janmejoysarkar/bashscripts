use rsync for backups on local drives. Use Grsync for GUI of rsync.
Use rsync with '--delete' or Delete on Destination option to remove files which have been deleted from the source.

Use 'rclone browser' software for a UI.
The software can be used to mount google drive to a mount point. Same can be done using the commands-
rclone mount google-drive: /mnt/gdrive (or any other mount point)
NOTE: google-drive is a given name for the GDrive a/c configured in Rclone.

For unmounting, use-
fusermount -uz /mnt/gdrive
